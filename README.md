# hex-note
The Present:
Hex Note is a Twitter chat bot that speaks Hex.
The bot first retrieves OAuth credentials from Twitter, then moves into a processing loop to determine what to say.
Using REST calls to the Twitter API, the bot can find trends, users, and post tweets.

The Future:
I plan to implement multithreading and running the bot as a service.
I also plan to expand the bot by adding more 'thoughtful' speech patterns.
